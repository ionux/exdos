What is ExDOS?
==============
ExDOS is a 32-bit hobbyist operating system written entirely in assembly language for the x86. Although the name may imply it is a DOS-like system, ExDOS is not DOS-like. Unlike DOS, it doesn't support segmentation, and it supports virtual memory, memory management and ring 3 protection.  
The ExDOS kernel is the core of the ExDOS operating system. It carries out the basic tasks of the system, like managing memory, taking input, displaying output, etc...

Features
========
- Boots in less than 5 seconds on most hardware.
- Ring 3 protection.
- ACPI (with shutdown and reset!)
- PCI driver.
- PS/2 keyboard & mouse drivers.
- BIOS disk access.
- VESA 2.0 framebuffer driver.
- Basic graphical routines (lines, squares, bitmap fonts, alpha blending, ...)
- Physical/virtual memory management.
- Heap management.
- Custom file system.

TO-DO
=====
- Port OS to x86_64 while remaining compatible with 32-bit applications and drivers.
- Finish the v8086 monitor.
- Driver interface.
- IDE ATA driver.
- SATA (AHCI) driver.
- USB 1 (UHCI/OHCI) drivers.
- USB 2 (EHCI) driver.
- RTL8139 NIC driver (for QEMU.)
- NE2000 driver (for Bochs.)
- Full TCP/IP implementation.

Build instructions
==================
You will need [FASM](http://flatassembler.net/) to build ExDOS, as ExDOS is written in FASM. First, clone the repository, and `cd` to it. Then, run `chmod a+x mkdiskimage.sh`. After this, all that is needed is simply `./mkdiskimage.sh`. The newly made file `exdos.img` can be used with Bochs or QEMU as a hard disk image. For Bochs, the CHS values are 71/16/63, respectively.

Requirements
============
- **CPU:** Intel Pentium II or better with SSE support, or AMD equivalent.
- **RAM:** Approx. 32 MB more than VGA memory.
- **Disk space:** 1 MB.
- **Graphics:** VESA 2.0-compatible card with 2 MB of VGA memory.

About
=====
ExDOS is a small hobby OS, and is actively developed by Omar Mohammad since late 2014 and early 2015. Back then, however, it was known by two different names: Zero OS and Vector OS.
